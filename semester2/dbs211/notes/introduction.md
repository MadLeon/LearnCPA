## Data vs. Information

**Data**

the raw unprocessed strings, numbers, dates, ... that is simply stored.

**Information**

reveals the meaning of data and is produced through the processing of the data into meaningful output, summations and categorizations.

## Data Redundancy

Data that is stored in more than one location has inherent problems.

## Data Repetition

Data that is stored in one location, but repeated many times also has inherent problems.

## Data Anomalies

3 types of data anomalies

- modification
- insertion
- deletion

### Modification Anomalies

A modification anomaly occurs when changing one records data leaves another records data in error.

Note: conflicts

### Insertion Anomalies

Note: Not complete

### Deletion Anomalies

The removal would result in the loss of

## Database Design

- primary key / unique identifier for every Table or Entity
- avoid redundant
- avoid repetitive
- include any calculated fields or values that are directly derived from other fields
- Every cell must have atomic values (a single value).
